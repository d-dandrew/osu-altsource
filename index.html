This has been discussed to be quite bad and must not be the case (see [discord](https://discord.com/channels/188630481301012481/188630652340404224/1197514459695034428)).\r\n\r\nThe constant width for the input drum has been defined to be 180px, visually matching osu!stable on classic skin.

When stable looks up the element, it will not match it with any texture file in the user's skin, due to the user's skin not having any texture file with the path explicitly being `SB/k/hitcircle@2x.png` for example.\r\n\r\nHowever, in lazer, `GetTexture` strips out the directory name and looks up for a texture that matches only the file name, leading to the hitcircles requested from the storyboard to be incorrectly sourced from the user's selected skin when beatmap skin is turned off, rather than the beatmap's textures.\r\n- Fix storyboard animations stripping path directory on skin lookup (ppy/osu#26599 by @frenzibyte)\r\n\r\n## Song Select\r\n\r\n### Automatically select search text when pressing enter to select a mod at mod select (ppy/osu#26178 by @felipemarins)\r\n\r\n### Fix osu! logo being mispositioned in song select on very wide resolutions (ppy/osu#26773 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| :---: | :---: |\r\n| ![CleanShot 2024-01-29 at 11 46 48](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/674785a3-5092-4b04-ada7-9f22841b65c0) | ![CleanShot 2024-01-29 at 11 46 24](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/73c7ac8c-8d63-4029-8705-e9c6c912372d) |\r\n\r\n### Smaller changes\r\n\r\n- Fix some elements not showing on leaderboard scores when almost off-screen (ppy/osu#26565 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n## Tournament\r\n\r\n### Fix tournament beatmap backgrounds occasionally not loading (ppy/osu#26587 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nThis also shows an empty beatmap instead of nothing when no beatmap is selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @felipemarins made their first contribution in https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26178\r\n* @kyubxy made their first contribution in https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26562\r\n* @mouzedrift made their first contribution in https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26608\r\n* @myQwil made their first contribution in https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26689\r\n* @hrfarmer made their first contribution in https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26740\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ppy/osu/compare/2024.114.0...2024.130.2","minOSVersion":"13.4","downloadURL":"https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/download/2024.130.2/osu.iOS.ipa","size":198450834}],"subtitle":"A free-to-win rhythm game.
