To make it feel correct (ie. disappear as it collides with the hitcircle, *not when it overlaps the border*) we need to expand it slightly.\r\n\r\nNote that this fix only affects classic/legacy skins.\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| :---: | :---: |\r\n| ![2024-02-21 13 49 47@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/507d8e42-1505-40cd-9312-67e7b1d11ef6) | ![2024-02-21 13 50 27@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/ce514f72-a37a-4acc-8dc3-b1a158857814) |\r\n| ![2024-02-21 13 47 25@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/430c20a1-bb1c-48bc-9ce0-5caba10f41eb) | ![2024-02-21 13 45 42@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/e74d22dc-1974-46c2-a262-186d225fefe0) |\r\n| ![2024-02-21 13 46 56@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/3ff4ff12-0b65-474b-bf2d-17701b9a009e) | ![2024-02-21 13 45 28@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/678bbde2-fa5f-407a-86eb-9705f3299994) |\r\n| ![2024-02-21 13 46 39@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/cfa7ac94-83bc-41cf-bda3-0260c573af23) | ![2024-02-21 13 45 50@2x](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/da822347-bc4e-4616-9861-a6fa0b51984d) |\r\n\r\n### Fix classic skin follow circles animating from incorrect starting point (ppy/osu#27288 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n- Reduce osu editor allocations with many objects selected (ppy/osu#27249 by @EVAST9919)\r\n- Reduce mania editor allocations with many objects selected (ppy/osu#27275 by @EVAST9919)\r\n- Apply padding to `GridContainer`s directly where possible (ppy/osu#27278 by @EVAST9919)\r\n- Fix allocations in `SliderInputManager.updateTracking` (ppy/osu#27230 by @EVAST9919)\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\n### Remove Veldrid OpenGL renderer, always use (legacy) GLRenderer (ppy/osu-framework#6193 by @smoogipoo)\r\n\r\nSpurred by people using this renderer, likely because \"legacy\" has a bad connotation associated with it (e.g. https://discord.com/channels/188630481301012481/1097318920991559880/1209220240383418438).\r\n\r\nThis forces `GLRenderer` (\"legacy\") to be used even when the `OpenGL` renderer type is selected.\r\n\r\n## Song Select\r\n\r\n### Fix beatmap carousel ordering not matching expectations (ppy/osu#27292 by @bdach)\r\n\r\nBroke in yesterday's release, oops.\r\n\r\n## UI\r\n- Localise storage error popup dialog (ppy/osu#27258 by @Loreos7)\r\n- Update markdown code block implementation in line with framework changes (ppy/osu#27218 by @frenzibyte)\r\n","minOSVersion":"13.4","downloadURL":"https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/download/2024.221.0/osu.iOS.ipa","size":193452291}],"subtitle":"A free-to-win rhythm game.
