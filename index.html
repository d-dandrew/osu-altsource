Fixes issue that occurs on *about* 245 beatmaps[^1] and was first [described by me on discord](https://discord.com/channels/188630481301012481/188630652340404224/1154367700378865715) and then [rediscovered again](https://gist.github.com/bdach/414d5289f65b0399fa8f9732245a4f7c#venenog-on-ultmate-end-by-blacky-overdose-631) during work on https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26405.\r\n\r\n## Song Select\r\n\r\n### Improve speed of beatmap carousel load when scrolling (ppy/osu#26385 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/ccf0f103-2ece-415b-9bee-b8b578b6955f\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\nThe preload numbers are still on the conservative side. We can probably adjust these based on the system the game is running on in the future. Or across the board. But this should improve the overall responsiveness of carousel loading, something that's been bugging me for quite a while now (and [not just me](https://github.com/ppy/osu/discussions/26243))\r\n\r\n### Smaller changes\r\n\r\n- Fix mod score multiplier rounding to 1.00x with specific mod combinations (ppy/osu#26140 by @CaffeeLake)\r\n- Remove scores from song select leaderboard when leaving the screen (ppy/osu#26410 by @peppy)\r\n  - Noticed they would disappear-then-appear after visiting the ranking screen. Which feels very weird.\r\n- Fix crash when clicking osu! logo in song select immediately after exiting (ppy/osu#26437 by @bdach)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @zacwm made their first contribution in https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26411\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ppy/osu/compare/2024.106.0...2024.113.0","minOSVersion":"13.4","downloadURL":"https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/download/2024.113.0/osu.iOS.ipa","size":194870426}],"subtitle":"A free-to-win rhythm game.
