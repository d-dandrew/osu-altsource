Currently known by and released under the release codename \"lazer\". As in sharper than cutting-edge.","iconURL":"https://github.com/ppy/osu/raw/master/assets/lazer.png","versions":[{"version":"2023.1229.0","date":"2023-12-28T18:16:07Z","localizedDescription":"## Editor\r\n\r\n### Add visual offset to better align editor waveforms with expectations (ppy/osu#26136 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nIn preparation for locking in better audio constants in lazer, let's fix the editor waveform looking completely misaligned.\r\n\r\nThis adds a visual-only offset to better align the editor waveform (in the timeline and on the timing screen) with osu! community expectations. With this change, visual-based timing is feasible, and assuming done correctly, should be accurate within 2 ms.\r\n\r\n### Fix editor timing mode not handling undo/redo correctly (ppy/osu#26141 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nWhen undoing, selection would be lost, and (kind of as a result) the controls on the right of the screen would enter a detached state where they don't update correctly. Quite annoying when you're making changes.\r\n\r\n## Framework\r\n\r\n### Fix audio being initialised more than once unnecessarily (ppy/osu-framework#6090 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n### Bump OpenTabletDriver to 0.6.4.0 (ppy/osu-framework#6086 by @X9VoiD)\r\n\r\nAdded support for:\r\n\r\n- Gaomon GM116HD\r\n- Huion Kamvas 22\r\n- VEIKK VK1060PRO\r\n- Wacom CTC-4110WL\r\n- Wacom CTC-6110WL\r\n- Wacom DTH-1320\r\n- Wacom PTU-600U\r\n- XP-Pen Deco M\r\n\r\nImproved detection for:\r\n\r\n- Artisul A1201\r\n- Gaomon 1060 Pro\r\n- Huion H1060P\r\n- Huion H420x\r\n- Huion H950P\r\n- Huion Kamvas 20\r\n- Huion Kamvas Pro 24 (4K)\r\n- Kamvas Pro 13 (2.5k)\r\n- UGEE S640\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n- Huion Q11K: Fix digitizer specifications\r\n- XP-Pen Star 05 V3: Fix digitizer specifications\r\n\r\n### Fix \"Windows Ink\" events being handled as touch events (ppy/osu-framework#5309 by @Susko3)\r\n\r\nThis fixes some tablet devices incorrectly enabling the \"touch device\" mod.\r\n\r\n### Smaller changes\r\n\r\n- Rename concept of \"global\" mixer with \"fallback\" (ppy/osu-framework#6091 by @peppy)\r\n- Add basic global statistics for input handler events (ppy/osu-framework#6087 by @Susko3)\r\n- Add low latency initialisation support on windows by directly interacting with WASAPI (ppy/osu-framework#6088 by @peppy)\r\n  - Seems good, but had issues.\r\n- Disable WASAPI initialisation mode for now (ppy/osu-framework#6093 by @peppy)\r\n  - Need some more time to test this out. As I kinda expected, it doesn't work well across the board.\r\n- Update framework (ppy/osu#26159 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n- Bail from score submission if audio playback rate is too far from reality (ppy/osu#26138 by @peppy)\r\n  - Handles cases where audio drivers aren't working as expected.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay (osu!)\r\n\r\n### Add new mod \"Depth\" (ppy/osu#25653 by @EVAST9919)\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/22874522/c300604e-85b3-4569-b9b1-2d7860d1bec4\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\n### Update argon and triangles slider tick/end miss to match display style (ppy/osu#26120 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/780b0a80-a25c-4948-ab0e-29edf019edbe\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/a0d17443-0103-4c1e-8e4a-bcfde9ea7c15\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\n### Add classic skin sprites for slider tick and slider end misses (ppy/osu#26117 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nA lot of complaints asking for disable on the new elements. Mostly because it was confusing to just downscale the normal miss.\r\n\r\nNow they get their own sprites. And as a result it's skinnable for the people that are *really* adverse to change. You can skin via `slidertickmiss@2x.png` and `sliderendmiss@2x.png`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ppy/osu-resources/assets/191335/2a855d02-3a5c-4cd7-9772-fc8fdb484753\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ppy/osu-resources/assets/191335/77b928b4-cafb-4c3c-90ef-4be3b2233117\r\n\r\n### Fix spinner max bonus sound playing when seeking in replay (ppy/osu#26170 by @rushiiMachine)\r\n\r\n### Force minimum cursor size for click-to-resume screen (ppy/osu#26148 by @rushiiMachine)\r\n\r\nOn cursor sizes below 0.3x it becomes exceedingly difficult to quickly locate and then accurately click the resume cursor on the pause overlay as it could as big as a handful of pixels. In the event the cursor aligns somewhere on top of or close to the text, it becomes nearly impossible to find it as it's even the same color.\r\n\r\nThis clamps the minimum cursor size to 1x for the resume overlay, which is way more comfortable and less likely to cause the player to miss afterwards (note that not the entire cursor aura is interactable, only about 2/3s) and more closely resembles stable.\r\n\r\n### Smaller changes\r\n\r\n- Add new sprites for slider end / tick misses (ppy/osu-resources#300 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n## Gameplay (osu!catch)\r\n\r\n### Fix catch objects not being clamped to playfield bounds (ppy/osu#26158 by @bdach)\r\n\r\n## Gameplay (osu!mania)\r\n\r\n### Make mania scroll speed independent of hit position (ppy/osu#26131 by @smoogipoo)\r\n\r\nThis fixes skins using a custom \"HitPosition\" having incorrect scroll speed.\r\n\r\n## Main Menu\r\n\r\n### Add support for displaying online images on main menu (ppy/osu#26172 by @bdach)\r\n\r\n![osu_2023-12-27_23-29-31](https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/20418176/63647fea-2f2a-4cc6-9ba5-ba3dfe581bcf)\r\n\r\n### Move menu tips to main menu (ppy/osu#26182 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/7b91be71-c96a-4de1-a2a6-1a72fc50509f\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\n### Show supporter love message at main menu and remove the disclaimer screen (ppy/osu#26183 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nGoodbye disclaimer screen!\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/fa9c6c4d-7ebb-4ca4-80d8-6d5936257753\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\n### Always show settings section text on buttons (ppy/osu#26147 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nWas really annoying to decode the icons quickly.
