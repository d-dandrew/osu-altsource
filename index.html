Currently known by and released under the release codename \"lazer\".

It's intended to be a very quick implementation just to get the functionality back, and will improve in the future. Controls are configurable but default to `+`/`-`.\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/191335/659934e8-22ec-4e81-98a6-3d76e465cdee\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\n### Smaller changes\r\n\r\n- Change \"cinema\" mod to never fail (ppy/osu#26080 by @peppy)\r\n- Fix standardised score conversion failing for scores set with 0.0x mod mutliplier (ppy/osu#26082 by @bdach)\r\n\r\n## Gameplay (osu!)\r\n\r\n### Replace recently-added HP drain density calculation with combo-end bonus (ppy/osu#26083 by @smoogipoo)\r\n\r\nWhen maps have very _consistent_ density, HP drain is as harsh as it can get to the point that it feels like if you miss a note you can never regain HP.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to maths enough to fix this just from just the hp increase / hp drain side of things, so I'm taking another approach by adding combo-end bonuses similar to stable.\r\n\r\nStable gives one of three bonuses at the time combo:\r\n- [\"Geki\"](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Gameplay/Judgement/Geki) if every object was hit with a 300.\r\n- [\"Katu\"](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Gameplay/Judgement/Katu) if every object was hit with 100 or above.\r\n- \"Mu\" if any object was hit with 50 or below.\r\n\r\n## Online\r\n\r\n### Fix \"spectate\" button not always being clickable in online users list (ppy/osu#26081 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n### Smaller changes\r\n\r\n- Fix user profile cover showing 1px line when contracted (ppy/osu#26077 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n- Fix hovering a toolbar button while running an import or reprocess potentially causing a stutter (ppy/osu#26086 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n## Reliability\r\n- Fix hard crash when attempting to change folder location during a large import (ppy/osu#26072 by @peppy)\r\n\r\n## Skinning\r\n\r\n### Change version checks to account for users specifying incorrect skin versions (ppy/osu#26069 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nSome skins have been reported to use versions like \"1.5\", expecting \"2.0\" behaviour. So now anything above \"1.0\" defaults to \"2.0\" behaviour.\r\n\r\n## Song Select\r\n\r\n### Adjust BeatmapInfoWedge's beatmap length field according to mod rate (ppy/osu#26060 by @jeenyuhs)\r\n\r\nI noticed the displayed length of the beatmap didn't change according to the change in rate (BPM does). These changes makes the beatmap length in `BeatmapInfoWedge` refresh the same time as BPM according to the mods rate.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @jeenyuhs made their first contribution in https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/26060\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ppy/osu/compare/2023.1223.0...2023.1224.0","minOSVersion":"13.4","downloadURL":"https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/download/2023.1224.0/osu.iOS.ipa","size":194515741}],"subtitle":"A free-to-win rhythm game.
