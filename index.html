This makes it scale along with the playfield `Scale`.\r\n\r\n### Avoid stopping / starting gameplay when running behind but a replay isn't attached (ppy/osu#27504 by @peppy)\r\n\r\nShould fix the underlying issue causing the backwards seeks during gameplay.\r\n\r\n### Add \"Argon\" performance points counter (ppy/osu#27498 by @frenzibyte)\r\n\r\n<video width=\"80%\" controls><source src=\"https://github.com/ppy/osu/assets/22781491/46c21558-faea-4841-a1bd-dff1b62d928b\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"none\"></video>\r\n\r\n### Add new hitsounds for \"argon\" skin (ppy/osu-resources#311 by @nekodex)\r\n\r\nMy primary goal with this sampleset is to offer a fresh, modern take on stable/legacy's hitsounds that would work as a drop-in replacement for beatmaps that were created with stable/legacy's sampleset in mind.\r\n\r\nI've used reverb and increased stereo width to make the hitsounds less 'in your face' than the stable/legacy ones, making them more pleasant to the ear IMO. To compensate for potential audibility loss, I've used increased transients (punchyness), greater frequency range (with distortion/saturation/etc) and in some cases a volume bump to get them sounding equally legible.\r\n\r\nI also decided to shorten the samples (relative to stable/legacy) in response to modern beatmaps being of increased difficulty/hitobject-density compared to maps from back when peppy created the stable/legacy sampleset.\r\n\r\nIn theory this allows for new players to progress further through harder maps before feeling the need to find an alternative skin/sampleset to hear what they're doing accurately - at which point, there's now conveniently also argon pro.\r\n\r\nThe sampleset does diverge a bit in some aspects (i.e. spinner sounds, fail sound, etc) to lean into lazer's aesthetic, but otherwise I hope the hitsounds should still be recognizable as some facsimile of their stable/legacy counterparts and hopefully still feel and play just as good (if not better) than stable/legacy did.\r\n\r\n### Smaller changes\r\n\r\n- Fix `Argon` and `Triangles` spinner freeze at low replay speed (ppy/osu#27359 by @EVAST9919)\r\n- Fix menu cursor tracking rotation while override by gameplay cursor (ppy/osu#27412 by @frenzibyte)\r\n- Fix missing event unbinds (ppy/osu#27520 by @smoogipoo)\r\n- Add support for new \"argon\" hitsounds (ppy/osu#27535 by @nekodex)\r\n\r\n## Gameplay (osu!)\r\n- Fix old-style legacy spinner fade-in not matching stable (ppy/osu#27320 by @frenzibyte)\r\n- Allow pp for muted mod for any combination of settings (ppy/osu#27144 by @cdwcgt)\r\n  - \"Muted\" doesn't change gameplay so can we make it ranked when adjust settings.\r\n- Fix slider head being incorrectly dimmed twice (ppy/osu#27369 by @Detze)\r\n  -

getting randomised when last fruit has zero position (ppy/osu#27456 by @frenzibyte)\r\n- Fix catch pp calculator not matching live with respect to miss handling (ppy/osu#27489 by @bdach)\r\n\r\n##

updates on multiplayer and playlists results screens (ppy/osu#27331 by @bdach)\r\n\r\n### When discord is set to privacy mode, don't show beatmap being edited (ppy/osu#27440 by

performance by better handling sprites lifetime (ppy/osu#27454 by @EVAST9919)\r\n\r\nLet's use world.execute(me) as a storyboard example, since it has a lot of objects, which makes all the values
