## Known issues
Can't install previous version, only latest version on github release will be available on this repo due to the repo generate program limitation, fix solution is welcome.
Always shows update, even if you have installed the latest version. The osu packages manifest on github release ipa file is always 1.0.0 and doesn't follow the release version on github version refrence so it won't match, It shout be fix on the osu builder side.
